# RSM  System Reconstruction
This project focuses on the reconstruction of data obtained from the Resonant Multifocal Scanning Microscope (RSM) system. The code follows three main steps: mask calibration, data alignment, and the core reconstruction process. These steps are crucial for generating accurate 2D images from the acquired data.
# Steps:
Step 1: Mask Calibration
This step generates calibration masks necessary for accurate data processing. Proper mask calibration is crucial to ensure reliable reconstruction.

Step 2: Data Alignment
Data alignment is a key component of the reconstruction process. This step offers two alignment options:

1D Tracking: Use this method for data alignment.
Cross Correlation: Utilize cross-correlation for accurate alignment.
Step 3: Main Reconstruction
The main reconstruction process involves several important operations, including:
Pinholing
Scaling
Pixel Reassignment
Deconvolution
Usage:
Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
Open the provided MATLAB script for this code.
Execute the script to run the reconstruction process.
Note:
This code may require additional libraries or MATLAB toolboxes, depending on the specific reconstruction techniques used.
Make sure to have the necessary calibration data ready before running the code.
